// Instructions
// - Create variables and/or calculate:
//   - The gross salary. Use 500 EUR for now.
//   - Employee pension contribution, use 5% if not sure ðŸ™‚ 
//     - Taxable amount (salary minus pension)
//   - Now the #fun part - calculate how much the person is taxed based on:
//     - 0% tax on 0-80 EUR per month
//     - 4% on amounts between 80-250 EUR
//     - 8% on amounts between 250-450 EUR
//     - 10% on everything over 450 EUR.
// - Calculate the take-home pay by subtracting the tax from the taxable income
// - Output the final result to the console. [Come up with a nice understandable message]

// Get the app to work with the salary of 500 EUR first
